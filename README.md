## # Hi there 👽

I am currently transitioning into Full Stack Web Development through the IBM Full Stack Developer program on edX, building a strong foundation in modern web technologies. With a professional background in Clinical Psychology, I bring strong analytical thinking, a deep understanding of user behavior, and a problem-solving mindset, which I now apply to designing and building user-centered web solutions.

I am focused on developing a solid technical foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web technologies, with the goal of creating functional, accessible, and meaningful digital products. I am particularly interested in projects related to education, wellness, productivity, and digital tools that enhance quality of life.
